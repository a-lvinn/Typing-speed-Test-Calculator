# Typing-speed-Test-Calculator
A Python Typing Speed Test Calculator is a small application designed to measure a user's **Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy**. It typically works by:Presenting a text prompt (a short paragraph or sentence) to the user.Recording the time it takes for the user to type the prompt.Capturing the user's input.
**Typing Speed Test Calculator:**
This straightforward Python console application measures a user's accuracy and typing speed in words per minute (WPM). Features: Random Text Prompt: Provides a brief, random passage for the user to type; Time Tracking: Uses the time module to precisely record the start and end time of the typing session; WPM Calculation: Determines the final typing speed in **WPM;** Accuracy Check: Compares the user's input with the original text to determine the typing accuracy (percentage of correctly typed characters). Prerequisites: All you need to do is install Python 3. Since this project only makes use of Python's built-in modules, no external libraries are needed: random: Used to choose a prompt text at random. time: Used to gauge how long the typing test took.
**Getting Initiated**
Save the Python code file **(such as typing spped test.py)** to your local computer or clone the repository.
Use your terminal or command prompt to run the script:
A prompt text will be shown by the program. As indicated, begin typing the text.
When you're done typing, hit Enter.
Your **WPM and accuracy percentage** will be shown immediately by the program.
How It Operates The following steps form the basis of the core logic: A list of sample texts is defined. Time Elapsed is calculated a 
**WPM Calculation: WPM is calculated by dividing the total number of correctly typed words by the time elapsed in minutes.** 
Formula: 
**text{WPM} = {Length of Text in Characters} / 5)}{\text{Time Elapsed in Minutes}}**
(A common convention is to use 5 characters as the average word length). Accuracy Calculation: The typed input is compared character by character with the original prompt.
Formatting and File Types
The most common name for this file is README.md.

The .md extension signifies that the file is formatted using Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows for easy creation of formatted text (like headings, bold text, lists, and links) using a plain text editor.

Most code hosting platforms (like GitHub) automatically detect and render README.md files nicely for display.
